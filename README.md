# Brain Tumor Detection Project

In this project, I have implemented Real-ESRGAN and YOLOv8 to significantly improve the accuracy and reliability of brain tumor detection in medical images, introducing a novel and effective approach.

## Technologies Used
- **Real-ESRGAN**: Real-ESRGAN stands for Enhanced Super-Resolution Generative Adversarial Network. It was employed for image enhancement and super-resolution to improve the quality of input images. 

- **YOLOv8**: YOLOv8 is a state-of-the-art object detection system based on ResBlock + CBAM (ResCBAM), utilized for its ability to accurately detect and locate brain tumors within the medical imaging data. 

## Fusion of Technologies
The fusion of Real-ESRGAN and YOLOv8 aimed to leverage the strengths of both technologies, resulting in a substantial enhancement of the accuracy and reliability of brain tumor detection within medical images, achieving an impressive accuracy of 0.944, surpassing the accuracy of previous methods. 

This implementation has proven to be a significant advancement in the field of brain tumor detection and classification from medical images.

## Dataset
The dataset used for this project is the Br35H, an MRI image dataset for brain tumor detection and classification, containing 801 brain MRI images. 

## Conclusion
The utilization of Real-ESRGAN and YOLOv8 has resulted in a state-of-the-art solution for brain tumor detection in medical images. It has proven to be an effective and reliable approach, achieving a substantial improvement in accuracy and reliability.
